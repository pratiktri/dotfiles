# Lines that start with # are ignored
# TIP:
# - Only add commandline apps that aren't available/updated on OS repos; cause brew isn't available on FreeBSD
# - Apps that are already installed skipped
# - Those that must be kept up-to-date (eg rclone); manually brew install them after the scipt completes
